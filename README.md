# ticketingmod
A Minecraft Transit Railway extension mod that adds a more comprehensive public transport ticketing system to Minecraft. 


# Roadmap

Tickets:
- Start and end station attributes

Ticket machines (Seperate from those of MTR)
- Zone overrides (Make a machine act like it is in a different fare zone than it physically is)
